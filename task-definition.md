#  Guidelines for Deploying a LAMP Stack Application in AWS
Build and deploy a simple LAMP stack application ensuring you adhere to Well-Architected
Framework, especially scalability and availability.
## 1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering
- Define the Application Architecture:
- Determine the components involved: Web Server (Apache), Database Server
(MySQL), and Application Code (PHP).
- Identify requirements for scalability, security, and availability.
- Define expected traffic loads, performance needs, and security levels.

## 2. Provision the Infrastructure
## 3. Install the LAMP Stack
## 4. Configure the LAMP Stack
## 5. Deploy Application

## Part 2: PROXIES: FULL APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT

## 1. Project Overview & Objectives

### Goal
- Deploy your LAMP Stack application behind a reverse proxy or load balancer.
- Integrate monitoring, logging, and observability tools from the start, ensuring real-time
  insight into performance and availability.

### Deliverables
- A fully functional load-balancing or reverse proxy setup, with or without AWS-based
  services (depending on the project).
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
  - Centralized or distributed logging (e.g., CloudWatch).
  - Monitoring and alerting (e.g., CloudWatch metrics).
- **Observability:**
  - Documentation and Mentor demonstrations of the full setup, including security and
    performance testing.
